What happened is that if you weren't a suck up or good friends with management you were forced to sell Home Delivery to people that really didn’t want the product. When you have a question don’t bother going to a sup because 9 out of 10 they will tell you to contact customer service. Also watch out for the lady sup she knows absolutely nothing will not even look you in the eye speak or say anything unless you are management. She also has low patience and walked out of a meeting because she couldn’t handle the pressure. If you get the guy with glasses you might as well say you have no boss only time you see him is when he is talking with the other male supervisor. The leadership in that department is the only one that knows anything about that department and when he is off you can tell because upper management will avoid you because they cannot answer any questions or refer you to customer service. Even though leadership is a great resource doesn’t turn you’re back on him because before you know it he will be chatting about your personal situations to his girlfriends and then they will spread it around the floor. No need to contact HR because she will do absolutely nothing. Bottom line if your desperate and need a quick check go through the training its fairly easy and 2 weeks of easy money. But don’t take what the trainer has to say verbatim because he hated the job as much as I did I know because we started together.

Through land reclamation and municipal annexation, Boston has expanded beyond the original peninsula. After the coming of American independence the city became an important port and manufacturing center, and a center of education and culture as well.[13] Its rich history helps attract many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone attracting over 20 million visitors.[14] Boston's many firsts include the United States' first public school (1635),[15] and first subway system (1897).[16]rn rnThe area's many colleges and universities make Boston an international center of higher education and medicine,[17] and the city is considered highly innovative for a variety of reasons.[18][19] Boston's economic base also includes finance,[20] professional and business services, and government activities.[21] The city has one of the highest costs of living in the United States,[22] though it remains high on world livability rankings.[23]rn",2013-04-28,331,47,11,0,192,7,2,1

You lose points for each day missed even if you have a doctor's note the most they'll do is take away points for the 1st day missed but you're only allowed up to three days. If you had some wicked bad medical prob requiring a week or two off, even if your CHILD was the terribly ill one but you had to miss those days to be with your child, yup, sprint has no sympathy for your child's illness n you'll lose points that way too. Myself, I missed 2 days between dec n jan due to two deaths - one was a close friend, the other was my ex-husband. Missed half a day for a funeral. I can prove all of that but since we weren't related sprint wouldn't even look at it and I lost a total of 25 points. Ridiculous. A girl I worked with had a history of severe, debilitating headaches. She was a trooper though n worked thru the agony til she just couldn't. She was advised that if she left work she would be let go because of low points. She left, she was terminated for doing so...and she passed away a few days later at age 32. That pain she had? An aneurysm.rnrnAs if that isn't bad enough, I can also assure you no advancement in this place because it's more about who you know than anything else. rnrnThat said, there are lotsa great benefits. Often they'll offer an option to take early release, with or without pay, because of more staff than needed based on call volume. You can wear pretty much whatever you want (just a few exceptions) like jeans, sweats, hoodies, t-shirts, flip flops...and you can have purple or red or blue or whatever color hair, 42 facial piercings, tattoos covering every square inch of your body...it's permitted! It's also nice having free cell service (up to 30 family n friends can also get deeply discounted cell service thru you). Benefits package is wonderful n affordable. Working holidays like Christmas pays double time n a half. You earn around 11 hrs of paid time off a month which u can use or accumulate. rnrnUnfortunately, because new hire classes begin every 2 wks, you're expendable n they make sure you never forget it. My stats are impeccable, I've never been late to work, my supervisor couldn't be more pleased with my performance. Yet they wouldn't hesitate to kick me to the curb because of a surgical procedure I had to have done because of which my doctor refused to release me to work until a follow up appt. Sprint cares not that I have a doctor's note stating as such. Too, too rigid in attendance policy.  I'm currently job hunting. ",2013-05-03,336,48,11,0,468,52,21,13

Coming from ShopRite, and being micromanaged by four different managers in one shift, to be able to work for a smaller store where you're encouraged to take the initiative yourself and solve your own tasks was and still is a huge positive.

Managers at all levels (store, district, regional) are either under-trained or just uninterested and looking towards their next job.  The company is cheap when it comes to their budget, and unless you have a great manager with a sales floor background that works 60-70 hours a week, the store will almost always be dirty and unorganized.  Inconsistent recovery, new stock sitting for weeks/months in backroom, out of date planograms.

The hours simply aren't there to do most of what needs to be done.rnrnThe manager that I work for has little to no sales floor training or background nor does she care about how the store is presented to customers.  Her superiors don't seem to care that much because most of the stores in the district/region are in equally bad shape, if not worse.  The difference is our location.  Despite a fairly steady decline in sales, we're in a prime spot that doesn't allow our sales to drop crucially low, unlike most of the stores in our district that are in deep rural areas.rnrnOverall, with better leadership up top, it wouldn't be a bad place to work.

It took me half a year to get hired on and it was worth it (IMO). rnrnThe GoodrnA typical day of work, department would have meeting and address the daily work schedule ahead, the job consisted of packaging electronics of all sorts laptops, beats, printers etc. etc. printing out labels and scanning items from work orders drop off on our stations by the pickers. When there were no orders to package we would help out picking which we would use a cart or powered equipment and a RF Scanner to fulfill order tickets given by our lead. I loved that management was ok on letting us learn to use the forklift, cherry picker, stand-up and electric pallet jack as long as we did not crash lol. I learned how to pick, pack, audit, replenish, count, sort, data entry and use the powered equipment something that I thought I would never learned. the hardest part of the job I can't say anything really as eventually I got use to job to the point that it became easy money regardless if I was picking or packing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay, 3 month bonus, sick pay, vacation time and meeting interesting people especially during peek season.rnrnThe BadrnThis job is not for everyone even though I said it was easy for me but not everyone can keep up in a fast pace. The pay, as one of my leads put it this job is only good for people that are single, have a lot of free time and don't have to worry about school or family, I cannot agree with him any better, when peek season came there was a lot of moody and emotional coworkers that compliant to management about long hours. For 2 months (Nov. Dec.) we did at least 12 hours almost everyday which cause problems with other co-works. I HATED when peek season came because Staffmark loves to mass recruit and bring in anyone here and I mean anyone which cause problems because temps would come and go, train TOO MANY TEMPS, there was not enough room to work around, get into conflicts with employees, some of them were lazy and some would vandalize restrooms but not all where bad. Management sometimes where lost and would give a go around to employees especially around this time. As for my co workers I had mixed feelings, Some were awesome while some still had that high school mentality. At one point one of them made my life miserable and even tried to get me fired when I was a temp. I had to play politics with others because of time scheduling and not staying for OT and any petty thing which made it frustrated for me sometimes. that what you get when most employees range from 18-25 and throw in some 30-40 years old as well very childish place at times.rnrnIn the end, I had an awesome experience here, learned a lot weather good or bad and I would not change anything about it.",2015-08-25,1180,168,39,3,551,10,14,9

I loved 2 of my bosses, the third shoved me out without warning for no reason im one of the easiest people I know to get along with.  one of the hardest part of the job was scheduling due to hrs they allow, open 91 hrs a week and they were giving me 120 to schedule employees on. other hard part is meeting their demands on no hours or employees, working employees to death for 8.25 has a high turn over rate.people cant survive on 12 hrs a week for 8.25. rnthe best part of my job was the amount of customers I had built up in that store and who were loyal not because of bargains but because of my friendly, appreciative customer service, I built friendships there, when I relocated and the store has had 5 managers now in 6 months, my customers followed me not to shop but to tell me how poorly the store is now, other customers just wont go there anymore. sad situation when you push great employees out and keep people who will run it down or don't have any knowledge of retail or customer service skills at all ,company treats you as you are their retail police and you have to not only watch for thieves from outside but they view all employees as a thief also. they need to pay their people a little more and they may not have such a high turn over and allow more hrs per store to be able to accomplish daily tasks or reduce some tasks that are highly unnecessary. the amount of paper you print in a days time could save a few trees.rnworking here is work which im not afraid of doing but their is no work life balance as manager they want you there 70 hrs a week to run your store the proper way. I love retail and people and this place will burn you out. I maxed all of their bonuses until they decided to take the bonuses away from that store to just give me a raise instead. I bet each inventory year after year for 4 yrs until I relocated to fix another store then relocated again to fix another one that was in desperate need of a crew for weeks that I wasn't offered until 2 months later as the stock just keep piling up and piling up . policies can be broken by upper management but they will be quick to turn managers in for their untrained mistakes .",2019-05-09,2533,361,84,6,664,1,1,9

This is great for the top level executives, but makes it difficult for the lower level employees that are trying to find success at the company. There is a mantra you will hear constantly on the sales floor. Success at Oracle is defined as the three T's: Timing, Territory, and Talent. That means that if you're in the right territory at the right time you will be successful, regardless of how competent or good at sales you are. If you want to gamble your OTE opportunity on that mantra Oracle is the right place to be. The challenge is every year they reshuffle territories, and give all the work/opportunities you've cultivated to the new territory rep when they move you elsewhere (hence the importance on timing and territory). rnrnThis lack of care for the reps has driven morale down, and with the majority of reps seeing no success there is a constant black cloud over Oracle. If you are lucky enough to find a customer who wants to buy your solution the price point for implementation is usually 2-5x higher than the software costs. This usually pushes customers to the competition, and it's frustrating for the Oracle team since they don't get paid on service anyways.rnrnI could keep going on the challenges, but to summarize - a great place to go if you need a reputable company on your resume, but unless you are lucky enough to land a good territory in the right division, selling the right products, in the right market the long term career opportunities at Oracle are hard to find.

For example, I was employed as a front end assistant but I also had knowledge of how to work in the food court. With just these two positions, I was able to cashier, help other cashiers, work the entrance and exit doors, push carts, and serve and prepare food in the food court. I learned how to work quickly and efficiently here as well as sharpen my multitasking skills. The only complaint I've ever had while working here was the management. Not all of the managers were strict, but there were a select few who really liked to give me a hard time, to which I never found out why. I was not a favorite and that had nothing to do with my work ethic or job performance. I was a very hard worker and my efforts were often taken advantage of and under appreciated. rnrnThe hardest part of the job, to me, was keeping the members happy when they already came into the store with a bad attitude. The rude people who seem like they have an agenda to get you fired because something didn't work out in the way they wanted. Members pay to shop here, so they feel like they are entitled to a lot of things that they couldn't get at any other store. I've experienced threats, physical assault, and verbal insults about my own intelligence all because of a misunderstanding or because they already came into the store angry about something else and decided to take it out on me. Granted, if anyone does those things to a Costco employee, it's not like management will do nothing to stop them. Physical assault results in a permanent membership ban, and they are not allowed into the store again.rnrnThe best part of this job is the great money, benefits, and support you get from most of the staff. Costco does take very good care of their employees when it comes to sick/personal leave and are mostly sensitive about your well-being. They give you many chances if you mess things up and are mostly understanding. There are only so many chances they can give though, and once you run out, you can say goodbye.",2017-01-21,1695,242,56,4,381,1,1,8

Work life balance is not good for many employees, mainly the ones who know more than others. These people end up doing too much work, even their manager's work and cannot even take a break to eat lunch while their managers eat on time every day.

They passed over me, and held that jobover my head for my entire tenure, finally telling me there was a personality conflict and I would never get it. Odd, since I got along with everyone there... with the exception of one lady who came into our dept, where we were all friends, and made everyone's life a living he^&. She finally quit, and then did the same to another dept. She ultimately had to get a job as a realtor, bc no other place could stand her for very long and she had no experience to use for another position. Also, the manager was horrible. He would schedule a particular job to where on a Friday, I was doing three days of work (we worked a day ahead, so we did the weekend and Monday's work on Friday) The job had very demanding standards, where you were entering series' of numbers that corresponded with clients. If you messed up, the wrong client got billed. On a Friday, because of the scheduling, I would LITERALLY work a 19-21 hour day, and if I made a single mistake, I would be written up. I was once written up after personally saving the company $75000.. over something someone else did. I was also written up based on a sales person's accusation. This manager did a thorough investigation, wrote me up... and I went back to my desk and found the paperwork that exonerated me. SO much for being thorough if you don't even ask the person you're accusing for the piece of paper that would solve the problem. It was so bad I required counseling, and they told me they get a lot of people from Comcast, and the company's theory is that we are all monkeys and if they burn one of us out, bring in another monkey. There were good people working there... friends for life... but it was an awful job and I ended up taking a %50 paycut just to get out of there.",2012-06-27,26,3,0,0,379,9,9,14

The hardest transition from me came through my promotion in which delegation and assistance was limited by management who preferred a hands off approach in order to get operations finished.

You pretty much go over the basics of troubleshooting and you don't learn everything because they say there's so much to cover. And for that you do have conitnued education.When you hit nesting, they teach you a little bit about handling calls on your own with a mentor, and that's the only hands on training you get. Then once you hit production they throw you to the wolves. You'll get calls that you've never dealt with. Things change all the time. Nothing works for everyone. They tell you it's easy to get promoted and get better hours, but once you start working you realize it's a LIE!!! You spent a lot  of time troubleshooting with customers who are either not tech savvy or call to prove they can do your job better than you can.They base your schedule off what hours they promised Apple. So changing your schedule or requesting time off is difficult. You will be forced to work weekends and get no say so about what schedule would work best for you. You have to work what they give you; no IF, AND, or BUT about it. Those who are looking for promotions, good luck. They make it hard for you to get good CSATs to get the percentages you need to be considered for a promotion or a schedule change. The customers have too much power in their hands, and even if they give you a good review but talk about how terrible the other advisors were, you still get dinged for it. This isn't the greatest company and it definitely shows. They supposedly hire 100+ people a week but only about 10-20 stay. Then the numbers will drop again making it harder . The turnover rate is high and the retention rate is low. It was probably a good company when it were Xerox but not anymore. I'm barely hanging in there and it's slowly draining my life and time away.

This turned out not to be the case. rnTraining classes are either very early, or very late, which does make a more difficult start to the experience. rnI will say the training staff is great and the training experience was good, other than the schedule. rnThe very best part of the job is the people you'll meet and work with there.rnUnfortunately, it is after training that you are thrown into the full reality of the job.rnA typical day involves mostly stressful calls, with mostly unhappy, rude and impatient customers. In my brief experience this applies to both customer care and tech support. Tech support is usually more stressful and unpleasant because customers have already been on the phone for some time and are usually extremely impatient. No matter how much all the provided information and resources provided to us was emphasized during training, I found that way too often it did not provide the answer or technical resolution i needed for the customer. It was a regular occurance to have technical issues which kept me from accessing a particular article or information that I had to hope just might answer the customers question or issue. Too often the step by step information provided that we were supposed to use for technical fixes did not solve the customer's problem. rn Immediately after training, I had to work too many hours or shifts with virtually no one available to ask a question when there was something I didn't know or wasn't familiar with. it is not possible to learn everything in training that will come up in the future. rnThe training and coaching staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. There were several times even after I got out on the floor that they did go out of their way to assist me with a more difficult question, but that was totally pulling them out of either their usual job description (and a different physical location in the building), or perhaps delaying them on their way to break. rnManagement was lacking after training...they did not ensure we actually had our supervisors scheduled or any support to work with. rnMy biggest mark against this company is the lack of opportunity to move into a different department or job description that would have suited me much better. This did not coincide with the opportunity for growth and advancement within the company that were presented during training. They way they feel it's necessary to assess your stats can work against you before you have a chance to move into a different group withing the company, as it did with me.  They place a high importance on customer surveys. While I understand they must do that at least to some level in this environment, customers will frequently fail you on surveys even for something that was completely out of your control or that you could not resolve even by using your resources.  rnAlso, it is very difficult to adhere to the breaktime and do what you need to do with having to use lockers, pass through security, etc. rnrnThe best part of the job is the people. The breakroom, cafe and amenities offered are also pretty good, so make a pretty good perk if somehow the job works out for you.rnI do have to say that the building environment is pretty dreary, depressing and dirty.

If i could do things differently, i would have scouted the locations around me, as you can apply at select locations instead of having your name picked from a list of ever-expanding applicants among a broad spectrum of locations, but instead of a manager simply picking a name from such a list, they get applications directly from those who apply to their respective locations. if the store feels like a match for you, go for it. chances are it will turn out to be a pretty good place to work, with good management, both store and district. otherwise, maybe look at some of their competitors, like Family Dollar, if it is more convenient,  although it might be the same situation anyway you look at it.",2018-10-14,2326,332,77,6,280,7,6,3

So they make you fill out this 3 page document stating goals you will meet.  Which is a round about way to only give the good ole boys a good raise and the rest 10-15 cents A YEAR. With absolutely no chance for a cost of living raise. People that have been there for 30 years brag about working hard and having perfect attendance. But they won't tell you they have easy gravy Jobs that were gifted to them. Nobody there wants to work hard at all period If you ask them to go to a harder area with more physical labor they turn their nose up and throw a fit  this place is awful I only recommend it to felons and addicts trying to get clean.,2018-12-06,2379,339,79,6,189,6,6,5

As a large federal contracting company, you have the typical upper management that only cares about the company's bottom line and seems disconnected from the employees that deal with the end users/clients.  In the past two years, General Dynamics has cut back on their benefit and compensation offerings, which (in my opinion), makes it a less desireable company to work for.  rnrnIn my 9 years with the company, I have been very lucky to work under some of the most loyal and hard working managers.

I really enjoyed my trainer then they move you to what they call BRIDGE. Once in BRIDGE they give you a supervisor who is responsible for about 20 ppl. There’s only one mentor and/or QA person to assist them. At first, I thought I was prepared for the job but I quickly found out we where just being thrown to the wolves. The issues we were dealing with, were not issues we were trained on. We were supposed to take calls during our foreign two weeks of training but that didn’t happen because everyone didn’t have their credentials to sign in. Plus the equipment kept messing up for a lot of people in my class. We used blackboard for training, they provided us with vpns that you keep have to resetting multiple times that kicks you out of the program. My equipment started messing up after I got in bridge. If you call IT  to fix a problem they do simple troubleshooting steps that temporarily fixes the problem but then the problem later comes back. Once you mention to them that then they look at you like you’re doing something wrong and you can still get written up for even though your still in “training”. rnrnBRIDGE is like the nesting phase they keep you there for 4-6 weeks. If they feel you’re able to work om your on then you “graduate” if not then you stay in brigde. Again, there is not a lot of help and you’re basically on your on. When they do come down to “critique” you they talk to you like you should know what you’re doing. Having different mentors everyday, you get different information, one person may tell you you’re doing something right. Then the next day the other mentor will tell you it’s wrong. For example, I had my supervisor tell me to tell a customer one thing, then mentor was like not that’s wrong don’t tell them that! Like who am I supposed to listen too? rnrnThe training could be better especially when it comes to looking up articles. I feel you should have the same team of supervisors/training throughout the entire training process. And the training should be more extensive and hands on. My hours are 1pm-10pm, so not much to do anything with my kids and family. You have to work weekends, schedule is not flexible but it is consistent. They force promote you, even if you say you don’t want it or you don’t feel comfortable doing it.  The supervisors and mentors are allowed to have their phones but the regular advisors are not. rnrnThere’s so much more I could say but I’ll stop here. The pay is okay but overall this is not an ideal company to work for. They have to adhere to Apples policy and they don’t care about you have a life at all.",2019-02-14,2449,349,81,6,489,6,8,10

However - at the call center, there are a small number of non-demanding back office jobs with a fair amount of autonomy.  If you have no skills/education and are willing to take guest calls for several years first ... and do a GREAT job at that - then you may apply for and receive a steady back office job with C grade managers and co-workers that are not very demanding.  I would not recommend this career path for most people.  There are virtually no opportunities for advancement.  However, if you are not educated and need a long-term steady, low-demand, low stress job ... that does not require continuing education, this path might be good for you.  Getting the initial Customer Care (phone) job requires passing a Gallup phone interview.   The questions aim to identify workers who will remain phone agents ... be satisfied with that work and so I don't believe it is good to answer questions ambitiously.  I would recommend this career path only for someone with great ethics and a desire to please ... but who has no expectations for advancing past a low-level manager or back office worker ... because there is (for example) a learning disability.  If you are stable emotionally ... a positive and ethical person but need the accommodations that support some disability and can tolerate receiving no authority... consider this option.

I was unhappy with these times but willing to give it a try, they sold me on the lie that most representative there makes over $10,000 monthly, and that there is no business like the car business. But 55 hours is a starting point, most if not all representative work 80+ hours a week due to the demand, a normal sale takes about 5 hours to complete on average, guess whos staying overtime if a customer walks in on the last hour of your shift? And don't think for a minute you can pass that customer on to another employee, that is YOUR customer, if you get into the habit of giving away the customers you will be looked down upon by management and will likely not meet your monthly quota.",2019-03-24,2487,355,82,6,213,8,11,4

In other words, I have been in an area with a high number of apartments and mobile homes, and these are not only hard to find but also usually result in lower tips.rnrnI also have to mention one major issue is the hours you work: essentially, when everyone else is off or celebrating a holiday, you are working.

I constantly have to tell friends and family I cannot be at events on the weekends because I have to work.

While there, I was promoted to an assistant manager without having full knowledge as to what every position entailed. That should have been my first sign that I wasn't in for a good experience. After receiving my promotion, it took about three years before my general manager decided that it would be a good idea to make sure I knew what I was doing and train me personally. During this time, I had to learn the entirety of the kitchen through regular cooks or, on the rare occasion, another more experienced manager. I also had to learn how to be a manager through my own attempts, not getting any guidance or information from my general manager without having to ask him. It seems like this was a common theme with the other managers as well, seeing as how each of us had our own way of performing our jobs that at times conflicted with one another. I'm not sure if this was a way to try to teach us about conflict resolution or not, but I'd say that from my own perspective there are better ways to accomplish that goal without sacrificing the operations of the store.rnrnThere was a point recently where the District Manager had come by and made a point to let me know that we need to make sure we follow all of the procedures as per health safety standards. I then went through with each cook trying to make sure that they were following those instructions to help our store stay safe. However over the next week, without any communication with me, nobody else continued to follow those guidelines and instead returned to holding food for well past it's time and then giving out that food. This was not the first time at this store that something like this has happened to me, but this was the time that I realized that the other employees didn't even care to improve the quality of food they were giving out. And neither did the managers or even the GM. We'd been the lowest store in the area consistently and that is why. How am I supposed to care about working somewhere when no one else does? When not even someone financially invested in the store doesn't seem to care about solving the underlying problems that ruin the entire store? The answer is I can't. rnrnGranted, this experience can occur at any location for any company, but this was my experience at my location with this company. If anyone asked me if they should work here, I would tell them to not to. It's not worth the pathetic pay, it's not worth the stress, and it's definitely not worth their time.",2019-09-05,2652,378,88,7,474,11,17,6

On any given day we would have 2 breaks and a lunch. We were all scheduled for 9 hour shifts with an automatic hour lunch. If you were a senior agent you would be able to take a half hour lunch and leave a little early or work over lunch if it was busy for a possible early out as well as possible over time depending on call volume. Most of the time there was only a couple seconds between calls on any given day. Being around the community was excellent. I loved a lot of the people I worked with. It frustrated me that people weren't being called out for not caring on calls and giving bad customer service because the other agents would have to deal with that customer later on and it is literally your job to be a good customer service rep. If you can't then you should find a different job that isn't based in customer service. I learned system protocols as well as data entry for new customers as well as data retrieval for previous customers. I really enjoyed most management. There was only one person in management that I really didn't get along with and that is because she really didn't care about anyone but herself when it came to work, personal, or other that was brought up. The hardest part of the job was staying positive because the people who were calling didn't ever want to be on the phone with you because they were trying to reach the company or it was a wrong number. Very rarely did people want to talk specifically with home advisor. The best part of my job was hands down the community.

You learn a ton in your first few years, but given the environment we're currently in, it's not a great place to be.  Legacy initiatives has destroyed teams and pushed out key employees that held legacy knowledge and skill sets.  Skills don't always rise you to the top, often times it's who you know which gets to be very frustrating.  Management moves slow when things could move fast to help teams be successful, and they move fast when clients are at risk.  With a little foresight, lots of issues could be mitigated, but they aren't.  Lots of proprietary organizational acronyms that have to be learned, State Street has a way of complicating things in this light for no reason.  Other teams look down on you if you don't understand the lingo as if you don't know what you're doing.  Lots of office politics, people talk, there's nothing you can do about it.rnrnFrom a positive front, it's a great place to learn the various ins and outs; assuming you have the time to do so.",2017-07-02,1857,265,61,5,193,10,8,11
