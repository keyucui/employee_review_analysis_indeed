I do all these things very well it is my first job and I do not even get paid well like I am basically doing 4 peoples job all at once. A typical day for me is if I open with a manger, I print price changes and some reports. After price changes are done I do the Fill Report and days where the store has a scan I have to do those reports too but while im doing those reports I have to help customers and maybe sometimes truck and cashier at the same time. My management team is pretty simple but sometimes are dumb to be management like no one is on the same boat or on the same stories. If I work with one manager that manager can do something very different than another manager would have done. Everyone does everything different which causes some pile ups and no one can keep there stories straight.

Well I don't know because I don't set the price and if i did I would have set it higher in order to get a profit but what you pay or what you think of the price does not make my paycheck any different. Then there are customers like why is the price so low...uh do you want it to be higher because I can do some magical things to make the price higher if you like?

Like you could tell whatever you like but I have no control or power of change things just for you like there millions of other customers that have opinions too but we can't just favor just one opinion.

Employees in sales are pushed to sell hard but the return possible makes it EXTREMELY difficult to make money there. If you sell $1200 worth of merchandise and up to 1 year later someone decides to return it, even after it has been worn, then you to have to take the return or try to sell them somthing else so you dont lose the commission. I would have customers buy clothes, wear it and bring it back a year later and I would have that commission taken out of my next pay check. You can try to sell them something of equal value or more so you dont lose the $ but a lot of times they will return it in a different department to avoid you and someone else will take the sale. Your first few months you can make good $ but eventually the returns will hit you hard. At least 1/3 of what you sell or more gets returned. rnrnIf you are looking to get into management, they promote fast from within, just work hard and sell your best and show interest in management immediately before your returns hit and SPH drops. 3 of the girls that were hired on the same time as me got assistant manager jobs in less than 6months of working there.rnrnEnvironment can be fun to work in but it can also be catty, especially because it is commission based. rnComplaining to management about your poor sales or mass returns won't help you.

Working in designer you are not allowed to leave your department to try and pick up from better foot traffic and make comission elsewhere ,unless you walk your customers over and want to shop for them in other departments.

Benefits include the basics: dental, vision, medical and multiple HSA options. About 80 in/20 out. Company offers on-site screenings for employees to receive extra HSA contributions. Free flu shots are given and gym membership included. rn   Across all hourly departments, you receive full-time hours, overtime pay, and a sense of fulfillment at the end of each day. Once a week you are given access to the factory outlet store and receive good discounts on company products. Around the holidays you are given free meal supplies and product free bee’s.rnrn    As a press operator, the break-time you receive does not always compliment the amount or extent of work being done. You are assigned between 1-4 presses, (typically 2 or 3) and given four breaks and a lunch break. Each individual break begins as soon as you are relieved by your floor person. When arriving at the break room, you have roughly 7 to 8 minutes to rest. Depending on the pace, number of presses, and/or how repetitive your assignment is, it is likely to be overexerted after these “too” short periods of rest.rnrn   Rubbermaid’s emphasis on quality plays a large role in what makes or breaks associates that are temp-to-hires. What may discourage temp employees are the careless efforts that both quality control and maintenance make to improve upon or fix defects. Press operators are frequently coerced by Q.C. to manually improve quality at the expense of risking minor injuries.    rnrn   Rubbermaid observes safety as a top priority controversially for the best, or worst. The best results from safety at this company are the financial dividends given from “CEO Reward” to management only. As hourly associates, you are NOT treated with a significant bonus for maintaining the bar of safety. All company safety implementations restrict the enviroment around workers, hindering some of their abilities and work style; and do not help to improve working conditions. Also, none of the company safety guidelines play a role in, or effect how team leaders; supervisors, and managers do their jobs.rnrn   The wide spectrum of employees at this company tends to be one of its biggest let downs. Many full-time associates are unable to meet the physical requirements of certain positions due to their disabilities and unhealthy physical attributes. This unfortunately creates more work and physical stress for employees that AREN’T disabled and that DO meet the physical requirements, yet for the same or less amount of pay and recognition.rnrn***Would not recommend long term employment to a prospective job seeker or friend.rnrn2.5/5 stars rating for this Mogadore, OH job.",2014-04-04,672,96,22,1,460,30,17,2

I really enjoyed the personal shopping/styling aspect of this job. The most difficult thing about this job was being expected to stay well-beyond the end of a closing shift. Regular closes lasted until the manager on-duty felt that the store was in acceptable condition, (anywhere from 2-4 hours depending on the manager, number of staff, and store condition). Employees were also required to stay for perfect closes wherein we would re-stock, re-fold, re-size, and re-hang every piece of merchandise in the store. These were surprise occasions that happened about once a month and lasted anywhere from 5-10 hours beyond a normal shift. For example, I once worked a closing shift from 5pm-10pm, then stayed until 7am to complete the perfect close. I was required to come back to the store by 10am for our quarterly sales meeting, and then work my shift from 11am-4pm (which included personal shopping for the daughters and granddaughters of the company president.) These instances did not include overtime pay, or extra breaks. I ultimately left because these extended hours began interfering with my schoolwork.

Now each rep takes turns greeting customers. This is kind of like having a cook come out of the kitchen each time someone comes into your restaurant. Very messy. Customer get skipped. The customer wait is so bad that its harder to make a sale. You will spend some days doing all technical support. It used to be easy to make 5 or 6k in a commission check.  This year the top reps wont even make 50k. The quota one month for accessories was just about the store record witch was set by me.  I know the goals should be high but either the company is really trying to cut cost by saving money or the people setting the goals have no idea and just out some crazy number.  The managers will say  you are going to hit quota and sell 10 home phones this month when most reps don't even sell home phones anymore. rn It pays fair if you are willing to drink the Koolaid but reps that have been there for a long time are sick of all the pay cuts.  The whole industry is cutting cost because most customers now do monthly installments on the phones instead of contracts.  Customers can say you did a bad job after the customer told you did a great job and you still get written up for it.  All the sales rep are scared and worry and complain a lot about pay cuts but the top selling reps get written up for it. They are now having you cold call to drum up business. rnIt feels like how much can we squeeze every way out of you so that you can make us more money.rnRewards points have gone away and the quota on accessories double? The management are nice people but to move up you have to brown nose and focus on being the best customer service rep. And since the goals are so high you most likely wont make any money.  The hours are like any retail store. Have worked to almost 11pm some nights when the store closed at 8pm.  You cant expect all your long time reps not to look for new jobs when they are getting paid of third of what they used to make. I know Verizon and AT&T are also cutting cost but they are such big companies that the job security is better.  US CELLULAR in the past 10 years has lost customer every year besides last year.   They put in a new billing system.  It goes down about once a month on average. Customers orders get stuck in the system and you have to smile and say You are not going able to talk on your phone for a day or two.   When they say a cut or a change is going to happy they say it with a smile and say GREAT NEWS we are no longer paying on this anymore and this is how we are going to WIN.  Will really miss the people I worked with and most of the managers. rnOverall you can make decent money if you are really good at sales.

It is NOT false advertising, but it is tricky and problematic, and management doesn't care that we have to deal with that on a daily basis. They don't care that they could easily make the signs clearer and avoid all that.

Even on a 100 score on Quality they would complain about something.  There is a lot of favoritism and no way anyone can advance.  They hire all managers and trainers from an out source and none of them have ever taken a call.  They are constantly begging for Overtime and there is no way you can balance life and work.  I had a full hysterectomy in April due to Cancer and they told me before I went out on short term disability for the surgery that it was not a good time for the business for me to be having surgery.  If I did not have the surgery I would have to go through chemo and still not be at work and I told them that but they didn't care.  I only took 4 weeks and came back full time right off the bat and they were begging me to do overtime.  They have been nitpicking me ever since I came back because I can't physically do more than my 40 hours per week.  My doc is afraid I am overdoing as it is.  This place is a horrible place to work and god forbid you collapse and have to go to the hospital.  You will get an attendance point and a write up.  You are suppose to die in your seat with no breaks before you are allowed to take care of yourself.  Also you get yelled at by 100+ patients a day because the pharmacy constantly messes up their prescriptions and all we can tell patients is to get a new one.

The most difficult part of this job was to manage time because customers want your full attention and you have tasks that have to be completed before leaving for the evening but overall I handled them with a positive attitude and made sure everything was done correctly and on time.,2012-09-25,116,16,3,0,179,10,6,1

A group interview, with a manager and district manager, which I now know was an expedited interview compared to the usual process of multiple interviews, which can take up to a month for a positive offer of employment. rnrnThey woo you with talk of advancement, raises, opportunities. They speak on being a family type of environment. Do not let this fool you. This is a trick. No matter the amount of initiative you show, hard work or dedication, you will still be paid minimum wage. rnYear after year, my surprise, you get a raise! was actually surprise, the provincial government is forcing us to pay you more, so here is a couple cents more per hour. Which actually ended up being less money in our bank at the end of the month, because they reduced our commission rate after that to 1% due to the provincial minimum wage raise. They do not want their employees to see success. Michael Kors Canada wants their employees to make maximum profits for them at the expense of the employee. rnrnThe turnover at the company is insane. I stayed on for a couple years and saw many great hard working people leave due to the corporate BS.  rnrnAs a sales associate, you have strict dress code rules all the way down to the length and colour of your fingernails. Some stores will send you home if you show up to work not wearing makeup, or if there are wrinkles in your dress. You are forced to wear their clothes as dresscode, but yet you still get deductions taken out from your pay for these clothes. If you win a contest, they will take a certain % of the cost of the item you won out from your paycheck. If you have more returns than you do sales, they will take money from your paycheck. rnrnThe sales competition is so toxic. Coworkers will steal your clients, steal your sales when you're not there (or right in front of you). The company gives these KPI goals to the associates that are so hard to make if you aren't in an ideal location or if you don't speak a second language such as mandarin. The work atmosphere would be more enjoyable if there was a store goal instead of individual goals. That does not foster a positive team environment. rnrnYou will probably have to deal with more returns and unhappy customers in store than you have sales. Most of the business is online, so don't expect to make a lot of money as a sales associate. Expect to be in the back room packing boxes for online orders. Like mentioned above, you're only a walking Barbie for them being paid minimum wage.rn(which is ridiculous for a Billion dollar company, to be paying their front line staff peanuts when they can purchase Versace for billions) rnrnThere were some good things about working at Michael Kors, such as meeting and working with some really amazing people and learning some more insight into the industry. The work was not very hard on a slow day, and you could talk with your coworkers (just pretend to be busy). rnEach store would have a few bad eggs lets say but for the most part the people were good to be around. Watch out for snakes is my advice. People in this company TALK AND GOSSIP so much. Just ignore them and go to the back and clean. rnrnAs an employee, you are expected to show up for sometimes 6:30 AM meetings in the next city over while dressed to impress. These meetings can honestly be done over the internet or a powerpoint in store because the information is just the same as you read online in the corporate announcements. rnrnYou are also expected to do more work for less money, as every time there is need for visual merchandising and inventory control procedures (most company's I have worked for have had separate teams come in for these tasks). These are additional responsibilities they don't tell you about initially and do not offer extra compensation for, but always need to be done. Sometimes you will be at the store until 1AM and expected to be back at the store to open the next day. rnrnWhat else can I think of that was good, to counter all these bad points.... rna 50% discount on cheap Chinese made products... HA HA HA.rnThis is why you deal with so many returns and angry customers. The product does not last and falls apart, and you are left there to deal with customer service issues. DON'T bother learning the return policies or trying to enforce them because customers will scream at you until you get a manager and they get their way. rnrnHi to everyone who still works there, I hope you get paid better someday!

The idea for the role is to turn “service into sales” so discussing transactions and problems in the lobby then taking them to an office or scheduling an appointment to try to get the sale for a loan or credit card, etc. you are expected to have a set number of appointments each week and preset appointments for the upcoming week also. This means a LOT of time spent making phone calls to a list of names for clients who MAY be eligible for xyz product. Often this may mean calling 20-30+ people and not getting an appointment or any results from it. Management experience is that they are micromanaging everything and the sales goals increase while the amount you earn per sale has decreased in my time being with the company. The training left a lot to be desired but if you are a quick learner it isn’t too hard to pick up on the process and dealing with customers. The worst part of the job is the sales portion and pressure to meet a goal every month but if you like trying to track down clients on a regular basis then the other aspects will not be a big deterrent for the job. If you LOVE sales, this job is great. If you don’t love sales and meeting a goal is not satisfying for you month after month, this is not the job for you. Also every part of the company has trouble with staff being knowledgeable and very little follow through from management at a branch level and higher up management. Example: upon hire you will receive base salary with promises that in 90 days you will get an increase. There are employees that have been there for years that have yet to get that increase. Also tend to have very little value placed on employee input at a lower level for process improvement, etc but corporate does try to reach out for employee input through some online sources.",2018-04-21,2150,307,71,5,360,14,8,10

It was an extremely difficult company to get hired with, so I thought, until I met most of my training class. Everyone applied 1 time and got hired with a referral, even those less qualified than I was at the time. The training program is very fast paced and overwhelming, yet they don’t give you all the information you need for when you’re live on the floor. The call volume is ridiculous for majority of the year, which meant long hold times and many upset and disrespectful customers. The systems they use are extremely dated and always failing every single day, which made our calls much longer than necessary. Their website was updated almost 2 years ago and there are always issues with it, resulting in many more angry calls and a lot of times I could really relate with the customers’ frustration. I don’t understand why they can’t get it together. They are a Fortune 500 company, yet my raises were less than 50 cent per year while consistently meeting my metrics for majority of the year. Which brings me to the metric system. It’s better than it was because they didn’t use to give us a break on adherence when we clocked out for lunches and breaks late due to a call that went longer than expected, after several complaints they came up with a solution. It’s still very difficult to meet goals without feeling like a complete robot. If you do met them you are rewarded with quarterly incentive bonuses, which is a plus. If you or anyone in your home is a person with a weak immune system and get sick regularly, I wouldn’t recommend working here (unless you have an active FMLA) there are no sick days, paid or unpaid. Unless, your state has laws that protect you (CA gets sick days and CA KINCARE 👍). They do provide PTO, much more than many other companies, only thing is you select your time off at the end of every year and it’s impossible to foresee a cold or the flu. You can’t go to the bathroom too often either, you’ll come back to messages from your supervisor about why you aren’t on the phone. With that being said, the attendance policy is very strict. I’ll finish with this, they say they promote from within and they do have many jobs listed on the internal website ...BUT ... it is extremely difficult to get hired from within. This is where favoritism comes in. A lot of those jobs are reserved for hire or interviews before the job is even posted because managers and supervisors know when a job is going to become available and they help who they want to help. I thought this would be the job I’d retire with prior to being hired but unfortunately the stress was too much for my mental health and I had to move on.",2019-05-21,2545,363,84,6,494,7,9,4

Some people are lucky and are placed on a growing client or on a team that has a number of managerial-level people quit.  Others regardless of work performance can get stuck at the some position for 5, 6, or even 7+ years.  There are a number of people in the office I have seen this happen to.  What is even more alarming is that the office is growing and getting new business and not losing much business.  When there is a new client, State Street hires someone from outside the company rather than find a way to promote a current employee.  For example, they do not even move a current manager over to a new client so that an associate can move up to a manager position while still be familiar with that same client.rnrnThe company supports tele-commuting and does offer reduced work schedules to people when manpower resources are sufficient enough to allow one to reduce his hours.  In the first two calendar years, employees get 3 weeks of vacation plus 4 additional days (3 personal holidays and a day-off for your birthday).  You can also purchase up to 5 additional vacation days.rnrnOne problem the Atlanta office ran into lately is using up its parking space allotment at 3 Alliance Center.  State Street did a good job of planning a green office setup at the new office.  However, the Atlanta office has exceeded its parking space allotment based on the square footage leased by State Street.  Any new employee will need to park at Monarch Tower and walk over or take MARTA.rnrnState Street can also be cheap.  State Street corporate will not fund a low-key holiday party.  To have a holiday party, the Atlanta office had jeans week fundraisers where if you paid $10, you can wear jeans for the entire week.rnrnOn some teams, the hours are really bad as in 70+ / week at peak times.

Everyone else hates their job, so you aren't alone.","I've never felt so under-valued and so easily replaceable in all of my life. My job experience is irrelevant. I'm treated like i'm incompetent and spoken to like a child. Things are repeated to me multiple times and followed with a don't let me down. I've never had positive feedback, only negative. All the positive points that the interviewer sold me on turned out to be not true. I knew I should have run away when I got paid .50 cents less than what was initially discussed. I was told they would work with my school schedule but that was far from the truth. rnrnManagement makes the job unbearable. Completely unprofessional. First of all, no one explained who the management team was, so when I went to the GM with questions I was told in front of customers not to bother him. Policies aren't explained, so its sort of a guessing game as to what you are supposed to do. Employees are disrespected right in front of shoppers by management. Actually, customers are treated horribly too. Their version of leadership is answering the phone and delegating ALL work. If you need help you are told that there is none, but they will pull people out of their departments to assist others, only making it impossible to get tasks completed. They add unnecessary stress to every task, as if we are trying to meet a deadline. If you have a bubbly personality or if you are outgoing and you are scolded and treated like a time waster and a time clock cheater. When customers have asked me to get a manager to resolve an issue, they have refused to help me and made me deal with the complaints.rnrnI've never seen such blatant favoritism in a work place. People who are promised positions are passed up for the obvious favorites. Hard work is rewarded with asking you to do more. The favorites will hang out with management and take extended long breaks in the office while others are running around like crazy people trying to get work done. If you aren't one of the favorites they will walk past you without acknowledgement like you don't exist. If they hate you they will look for anything to get you fired. (Did you hear about the guy with Fetal Alcohol syndrome they wrongfully terminated? That's a perfect example). If you are a bad employee they will just transfer you to a different store. All store managers change stores at least once a year. rnrnEmployee morale is nonexistent. Everyone who I have encountered hates their job.

They have relatively strict guidelines in terms call time, after call work, and micromanage everything you do (including using your break time to use the restroom, even if it's emergent). A typical day will result with you taking between 30-60 calls from student loan borrowers that fall into one of three categories: easy to handle, super angry/upset about something that happened. The calls generally are easy enough to handle, if you have a decent amount of patience and know how to manage your temper.rnrnMembers of leadership also fall into two categories: willing to go above and beyond to help you in several areas, or I'm just here to get a paycheck and micromanage you to death. My Team Lead and Supervisor have both been amazing and I have seldom felt like I wasn't a valued member of the company.rnrnThe company divides the employees into teams, which is nice. Each team will have random food days and it does a fair amount to lift moral, but only if you have the money to participate in the food day (if you didn't bring anything, you don't get to take part in it. If you're broke, sorry.) Your team is supposed to be a support system, as well as your work family but for the most part everyone just kinda keeps to themselves. You can tell the ones that are getting burned out because of the constant need for mandatory OT.rnrnThe hardest part of the job is meeting the metrics. I am a sales person. That's what I have done most of my life. I talk. I'm a talker. This job is not for you if you like to talk. You are expected to keep your calls at less than 8 minutes, your after call work (wrap up or summary of the call, as each account is notated with what you and the borrower discussed) to less than a minute, and hold times to less than 30 seconds. Hold times are easy enough. After call work is a little more challenging if you're like me, and can't type and talk at the same time. Talk times are the most challenging one to meet because of the reasons I have mentioned above. I have had calls that went on for 30-90 minutes because I was either arguing with a borrower, or had to explain what was going on or the options the borrower had a multitude of times.rnrnThe most enjoyable part of the job, aside from the food days, is talking to people from all walks of life, the rich and well off to the broke and unemployed. Everyone is different and for the most part, it's enjoyable. The fact that Nelnet, Inc. takes part in several different charities is also very nice. They help with Habitat for Humanity, Junior Achievers, and United Way. They do give back to the community, and that's refreshing to see.",2018-09-14,2296,328,76,6,544,26,22,11

Safety is number one at Schneider. The open office layout can be very noisy and it is hard at times to stay concentrated on your job. You can enjoy flexible working hours as long as you worked your 38 hour week. The most annoying thing I found was all the paperwork to be done to get anything approved, like work instruction. Getting anything  approved was very frustrating. Schneider-Electric ETOB could be a great place to work for if management would care more and listen more to their employees. Unfortunately, that is not the case, management attitude is if you don't like it, there is the door. The moral and motivation of many employees has suffered because of management and their attitude towards them. Don't expect a great salary, it is kept to the minimum. Don't ask for a pay rise, you'll never get one anyway. All in all, Schneider is not a bad place to work for as long as you do everything what management is coming up with. I would not recommend to work at Schneider-Electric ETOB to anyone. Even you work in a clean environment, the salary and wages are just a tiny bit above award. The management doesn't care much about their employees and have the wrong attitude. No wonder there is no future for this business in Australia and parts of the business is already done oversees. This will be in my opinion another business clothing its doors in Australia to manufacture oversees. A company restructure currently going on has costed many jobs, including mine.

The manager decided to punish me for missing two days of work (I had an upper respiratory infection that I had to go to the ER for) by making me work a full month of Sundays, which are markdown days so they're the toughest. After that she completely ignored me. She was a horrible manager! One week she loved me and wanted to be my buddy the next week I was her enemy. She also was very inappropriate with sexual conversations (while customers were in the store). I got sick of putting up with her and the company so one day I went to the back, grabbed all my stuff, walked up to the manager told her I quit, and walked out.

They had free snacks and all you can drink coffee, the managers (at the time) were very nice, understanding, and positive in helping their teams succeed. The company its self was very about its employees and customers, understanding that accidents happen, and family is priority. But, then the moved happened December 2018. Customer Call Reps were moved out of the office from the Sales team to a new location near Shops of Legacy. Within the first 2 months, id say about 60% of the OG call center reps (who had been with the company 3+ years) left the company. I do not believe that is only because of the location change. I did not know at the time one of the managers was promoted to Supervisor.. over the course of the next few months more and more reps left or were fired. Coffee was now complete trash. Turn over rates started going through the roof. Managers now had to be more strict on performance numbers resulting in less care for the customers. Then our jobs started moving to 5 star somewhere in S. Carolina? The office employees during this time were getting sadder and sadder, customers were getting angrier and yelling more on the phones causing some of our call times to go up, unacceptable.rnThe more understanding less strict managers were let go. The call center got quieter, and quieter, until there were days with very little calls. I personally started helping out the online maintenance request division (where customers submit online maintenance requests instead of calling them in), and did very well. The managers did not recognize that I was doing well in this area, and instead of permanently transferring me to that department, they let me go, with 3 other people that day. I think the company was originally what millennial's have been looking for, but something changed and I would no longer recommend this company as a pleasant place to work. rnNot to mention, people in the office who were talking about leaving, stated that a bunch of the OG reps who left right after the move went to a competitor company that paid more.",2019-12-05,2743,391,91,7,372,1,1,1

This associate was there for three years and had no write-ups, almost perfect attendance.  Also, biglots gives hours to people who do not do the work majority of the time.  mostly if you were a cashier you were given only 12.5 hours a week.  If you knew the store manager, you were given 27.5 because you are friendly with the manager.  I guess hard work does not go a long way.  They do have great sales, wonderful associates, and managers.

After the first month, they put me through training and paid for my class 1 licence, dozens of safety tickets, and all of my ppe.

How to work safely, work on the trucks, even how to act in the field - It was my first oilfield job. Lots of heavy lifting. Managed to lose 10 pounds working for them and my arms got huge. The management at Baker was great. Really good guys (and girls) working in the office. Very well mannered, professional, and fair.

Some of the guys working there are just awful people and there's nothing you can really do about it because they've been there longer. Lots of gossip in the company, if you say something or do something off key, everyone knows about it across north america within a week (for real). Field supervisors can also be really nasty - if you make them mad, they work you like a dog until they settle down and they always try and rush you during rig-ins and rig-outs. It's very difficult to move up quickly in the company because there are so many guys working there, all after the more senior roles. Baker also had 3 massive layoffs in the 11 months that I was working there.rnrnThere were a lot of good times at Baker but there were also a lot of bad times in terms of some of the guys I had to work with in the field.

The staff discount of 50% on owned or licensed brands, limited to £1200 per year, is also one of the best I have come across.  The only real downside is the lack of locations outside of London. The limited number of concession locations means that progression can be more difficult as suitable vacancies can take time to become available. However the business is growing steadily and they are opening new sites every year, meaning that if you stick with them there is a real possibility to be offered that next step on your career ladder. There can also be days where you have very few customers due to the high priced products on offer. This is a role that can be both faced paced at strong retail periods but also much more relaxed when the public are being more cautious with their cash.rnrnOverall this is a fun, exciting company to work for that offers great benefits and recognition to everyone.

There are days where I work in that department and feel like I'm drowning in clothes.rnrnThen there are departments like Men's clothing where employees will be standing around all day, maybe fixing a folded clothing table or two and putting away a few shirts but overall, not much.  rnrnAs you can see, the work-load for each department is highly varied and it's a bit unfair because there are employees that are being paid at the same rate yet some have to work 10x harder than others for the same pay.  The managers will complain all they want about the Women's clothing department not being kept clean by employees but in reality, it's a huge fault to the corporation that doesn't actively take action to fix the uncontrolled pileup of clothes.  Fitting rooms are not regulated, even if there's a stupid sign stating only 6 garments per customer.rnrnTypical day at work:rnDepends on the department you're in but if you're in clothing which is a good 70-80% of the store, you'll be putting away clothing or fixing folded clothing tables, walking around and asking customers if they need help with anything, directing people to different departments or the restrooms, and ringing them up at the register.  rnrnWhat I learned:rnLearned about different fashion brands and how to put together nice outfits, how to calm down and upset and angry customer, overall, just how to deal with all kinds of people,  picking up where different items are located quickly, the Macy's cash register system.  After working here, you should be able to get a job in almost any retail establishment.rnrnCo-Workers:rnThey're awesome.  Some might seem mean at first but usually you find out in the long run that it's just their personality and they're not intentionally being that way.  You learn a lot about different personalities.rnrnHardest part of job:rnPutting clothes away when there's a lot of go-backs and SALES GOALS!  rnrnMost enjoyable part of job:rnFun and friendly co-workers for the most part and making a customer happy.rn",2013-05-19,352,50,11,0,529,25,7,8

Also the people that work for the company are the best thing that you can hope for in a job. They really are like a family and that is what keeps most employees there at least in my experience. The tricky part about working for this company is that Nordstrom gives its employees and managers the freedom to use your best judgment reguarding any difficult situation that you come across. That being said, the company gives alot of freedom to management to decide what they think is ok and whats crossing a line so every single manager has a different idea of how things should be. this can make working for managers there incredibly difficult. And because Nordstrom has such an entrepenure spirit about it, there are a ton of bias involved in who moves up and who gets demoted/fired in the company. You can be a top seller and work for the company for years but one day if a manger decides they don't like you anymore they can find a reason to fire you or keep you in your spot so you cant move up and thats it. I've seen it happen numerious times. and HR does nothing to help support the employees, they are there to protect the company that is all.
